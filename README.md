# Weather-app
Temperature, humidity, LED application with C and C# using Arduino and DHT22 ( temp. and humidity sensor). 


# Elements:

- Arduino Leonardo
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity sensor
- 220 ohm resistor
- 10k ohm resistor
- motherboard
- LED diode
- push button
- some wires

# Arduino Code and wiring scheme

Code is attached to this repository as ArduinoCode.ino. To create this file I was working in Arduino 1.8.8 IDE.
There are also two necessary libraries for DHT22 sensor here.
The wiring scheme is created with Fritzing and you can find it as ArduinoWiringScheme.png

# C# Application
